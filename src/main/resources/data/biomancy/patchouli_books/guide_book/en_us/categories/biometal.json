  "name": "Biometal",
  "description": "In Essence, biometal is a strange semi-living organic metal that looks like flesh and metal twisted together, forming a very strong and flexible metal. Being able to withstand high stress and heat it is one of the most difficult materials to destroy. Once injured it regenerates itself by consuming nutrients from its surroundings. Usually, biometal will have no visual wear and tear, except if it was starved from nutrients intentionally or by accident.\nBiometal has been shown to exhibit properties that could provide an ideal medium for certain biological applications and seems to be a promising candidate for the creation of synthetic life, as it is a very strong, flexible, and resistant material.\nBiometal can be used to create items with unusual and interesting mechanical properties. Although biometal is very tough, it is not really made of metal, so its properties can be altered in ways that would not be possible with other materials. The most common method for creating biometals is by the addition of metal elements to flesh suspended in mutagenic bile in an evolution pool.",
