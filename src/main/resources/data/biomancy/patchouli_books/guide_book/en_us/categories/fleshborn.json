  "name": "Fleshborn",
  "description": "Living tools known under the common name of fleshborn are in part, a product of the experimentation with parasitic organisms found in pig and cow flesh. A fleshborn tool is a living organism fused with biometal, that was born to fulfill a very specific purpose.\nFleshborn items are generally regarded to be inferior to living beings, having no intelligence or soul, but they have been known to have a higher than average level of longevity and resilience. While they are not considered to be sapient, some tools do seem to possess life-like characteristics.\n",
